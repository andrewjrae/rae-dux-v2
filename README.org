:END:
*NOTE*: this is currently experimental and has not yet been printed and tested

This is the successor to the [[https://github.com/andrewjrae/rae-dux][rae-dux]], with many improvements, largely in the flow (fully automated routing finally works!).

** Changes from V1
- Ergogen V4
- Key layout tweaks
  - Pinky moved up ever so slightly
  - Thumbs re-arranged slightly
- MX spacing preset, *still uses chocs though!* (gotta have that DES)
- [[#the-flow][Automated flow]]
- "Swept" outline for more stability and looks ;)
- Reversible nice-nano footprint so both controllers will face up
- Power sliders should actually match orientation for on/off!

** TODO
- [ ] Print and test the PCB
- [ ] Docs on the flow
- [ ] Automate DRC check + gerber export?
- [ ] CadQuery a case together??

** Inspirations / Credit
- The original [[https://github.com/tapioki/cephalopoda/tree/main/Architeuthis%20dux][A. Dux]] of course
- The [[https://github.com/soundmonster/samoklava][samoklava]] board and flow which I couldn't get to work for splayed direct-pin routing but inspired me to try more automation
- @infused-kim and their [[https://github.com/infused-kim/kb_ergogen_fp][footprint library]] which I made some minor changes to
- @yanshay and their [[https://github.com/yanshay/ergogen-stuff/blob/main/docs/router.md][router footprint]] which inspired me to make my own router footprint

** The Flow
TODO! (hey I said it was experimental okay?!)
